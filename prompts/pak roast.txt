Create a high-energy, up-to-date satirical roast of Pakistan, news, social media trends, and public discourse.

The tone should feel fresh, topical, and fast, like scrolling Twitter/X, watching breaking news tickers, and flipping between loud talk shows—all at once.

Focus on:

Breaking news that changes every few hours but somehow stays the same

TV anchors shouting “EXCLUSIVE” while explaining nothing

Political statements being contradicted before the sentence even finishes

Cricket discussions hijacking every serious national issue

Load shedding, traffic, and inflation treated as “character development”

Viral memes reacting faster than official press releases

Style guidelines:

Use smart sarcasm, irony, and exaggerated metaphors

Sound like a clever commentator observing chaos with a straight face

Short punchy lines mixed with a few longer, dramatic observations

Make it feel like “this literally just happened” energy

Constraints:

No hate, slurs, or attacks on religion, ethnicity, or common people

Roast systems, habits, media culture, and political theatrics—not individuals

Keep it humorous, self-aware, and relatable

End with a punchline that implies:
“Same country, new headlines, zero plot resolution.”
