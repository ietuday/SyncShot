Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.00,0:00:32.60,Default,,0,0,0,, period so,\N so unique. We're focusing mainly on the years 55 A.C. to 58 A.C.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.64,0:00:36.67,Default,,0,0,0,, Roughly,\N though we'll glance a bit beyond that too. It's a mix,\N isn't it? Amazing

Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.84,0:00:50.87,Default,,0,0,0,, conciliator,\N right? His reign gets called a golden age. And you can see why on the
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.87,0:00:54.35,Default,,0,0,0,, surface. For sure,\N long stretches of peace,\N prosperity,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.35,0:00:58.07,Default,,0,0,0,, westeros,\N the population apparently doubled and King's landing quadrupled.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.07,0:01:01.64,Default,,0,0,0,, That's huge. Yeah. And things like grain,\N fish prices drop.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.64,0:01:06.23,Default,,0,0,0,, Trade was booming. Crafts were flourishing,\N you know,\N farriers,\N goldsmiths,\N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.28,0:01:55.40,Default,,0,0,0,, And immediately,\N you see the impact on Queen Rina Targaryen,\N area's mother.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.60,0:01:59.28,Default,,0,0,0,, She was,\N well,\N just break completely understandable. She'd left court taking

Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.79,0:02:06.56,Default,,0,0,0,, Searching. Old town,\N high garden,\N cray call,\N casterly rock.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.60,0:02:09.31,Default,,0,0,0,, Just tireless and fruitless,\N sadly.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.48,0:02:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,, And then there's that account of her confrontation with Lord Franklin
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.92,0:02:18.68,Default,,0,0,0,, Farman on Fair Isle. She basically landed dream fire there and didn't hold back.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.87,0:02:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,, doesn't it? Between Rina's approach and Jehary's,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.04,0:02:28.43,Default,,0,0,0,, Sempton Barth had that insight about the dragons. Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.84,0:02:32.12,Default,,0,0,0,, That Targaryen power was immense,\N but the threat of it,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.92,0:02:37.92,Default,,0,0,0,, that was most potent when it was unspoken. Jehary's got that subtlety. Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.43,0:02:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,, Rina though,\N she was direct,\N even reportedly boasted about,\N you know,\N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.52,0:02:52.20,Default,,0,0,0,, No. And after that,\N she kind of retreated,\N flew over lonely places,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.40,0:02:56.12,Default,,0,0,0,, still searching,\N maybe just grieving,\N hard to say for sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.36,0:02:58.32,Default,,0,0,0,, So while Rina is searching the skies,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.56,0:03:01.56,Default,,0,0,0,, you've got this other audacious thing happening across the narrow sea,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.96,0:03:05.80,Default,,0,0,0,, Alyssa Farman. Ah,\N yes,\N calling herself Alice Westhold by then.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.80,0:03:08.96,Default,,0,0,0,, And using those dragon eggs,\N she stole the ones Rina interested to her.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.96,0:03:13.71,Default,,0,0,0,, Exactly. Using them to fund building this ship,\N the sun chaser in bravos.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.00,0:03:18.24,Default,,0,0,0,, And this wasn't just any ship. No,\N a four-masted carrot built for long
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.24,0:03:21.64,Default,,0,0,0,, voyages,\N deep waters. She was planning something big.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.76,0:03:24.96,Default,,0,0,0,, People asked if she was sailing to ET and she apparently just laughed
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.56,0:03:28.15,Default,,0,0,0,, so she was going much further. Yeah. Beyond the sunset.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.48,0:03:30.56,Default,,0,0,0,, It's a fascinating clash of visions there.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.56,0:03:34.15,Default,,0,0,0,, You have the maesters still kind of debating the edges of the known world.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.68,0:03:39.92,Default,,0,0,0,, And Alyssa Farman is just convinced the world is far larger and far stranger than the
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.92,0:03:42.96,Default,,0,0,0,, maesters imagine. She wasn't just looking for trade routes.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.00,0:03:45.32,Default,,0,0,0,, No,\N she was looking for a whole new condense,\N wasn't she?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.47,0:03:48.47,Default,,0,0,0,, Another SOS,\N another Sothorios,\N another Westeros.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.75,0:03:53.15,Default,,0,0,0,, It's incredibly bold,\N especially when you think about past failures like brand
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.15,0:03:55.91,Default,,0,0,0,, and the ship right,\N sailing north and vanishing. True.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.31,0:04:01.12,Default,,0,0,0,, But Alyssa heading south,\N paying triple wages,\N getting those high tower grandson's
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.12,0:04:06.07,Default,,0,0,0,, on board. She had serious conviction and a plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.15,0:04:09.24,Default,,0,0,0,, So back in King's Landing,\N well,\N all this is going on the searching.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.47,0:04:12.71,Default,,0,0,0,, The shipbuilding King Jihari is dealing with his own anxieties.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.03,0:04:16.51,Default,,0,0,0,, How by working tirelessly,\N he threw himself into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.51,0:04:19.19,Default,,0,0,0,, And this is where one of his biggest legacies really starts,\N isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.83,0:04:23.07,Default,,0,0,0,, In 55 AC,\N the laws.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.24,0:04:25.68,Default,,0,0,0,, Oh,\N absolutely. With his smaller council,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.68,0:04:30.56,Default,,0,0,0,, Sept and Barth,\N Grandmaster Benefer,\N Lord Albin Massey,\N and Queen Alessane was involved
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.56,0:04:35.31,Default,,0,0,0,, too. Right. They started trying to untangle this mess of contradictory laws
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.39,0:04:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,, across the seven kingdoms.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.72,0:04:40.72,Default,,0,0,0,, Monumental is the word. Before Aegon's conquest,\N you had all these separate

Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.24,0:04:49.48,Default,,0,0,0,, like 97 kingdoms at one time,\N 132 at another.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.88,0:04:52.40,Default,,0,0,0,, And even after the conquest,\N it was still a patchwork.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.64,0:04:56.44,Default,,0,0,0,, Lord's pretty much ruled by whim based on conflicting precedence.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.56,0:04:59.92,Default,,0,0,0,, So Jihari's wanted to change that,\N bring a single law to the realm.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.92,0:05:01.56,Default,,0,0,0,, Exactly. It wasn't just tidying up.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.56,0:05:06.36,Default,,0,0,0,, It was about centralizing power,\N making justice more consistent,\N less arbitrary,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.72,0:05:11.36,Default,,0,0,0,, taking power away from individual Lord's whims and creating a,\N well,\N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.28,0:05:17.40,Default,,0,0,0,, Really,\N it absolutely did a fundamental shift.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.52,0:05:20.16,Default,,0,0,0,, But it wasn't all just dry legal work in 55 AC.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.56,0:05:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,, There were personal moments too.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.16,0:05:26.19,Default,,0,0,0,, Queen Alessane was pregnant again,\N which was big news,\N though little princess
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.19,0:05:29.80,Default,,0,0,0,, Daenerys,\N who was four,\N apparently insisted she wanted a sister.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.60,0:05:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,, Sounds like quite the event.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.88,0:05:50.28,Default,,0,0,0,, 77 nights,\N a couple of deaths,\N unfortunately,\N but Sarah Luke

Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.32,0:06:01.92,Default,,0,0,0,, But then Alessane decided to go to Dragonstone for the birth.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.36,0:06:05.68,Default,,0,0,0,, Yeah,\N the memory of losing Prince Aegon previously was still raw,\N right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.96,0:06:06.87,Default,,0,0,0,, She wanted quiet.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.87,0:06:07.56,Default,,0,0,0,, Understandably.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.56,0:06:11.72,Default,,0,0,0,, So Jhery's went on a royal progress alone through the Western lands and pointedly

Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.72,0:06:15.40,Default,,0,0,0,, I can expect a Barthus Point,\N doesn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.40,0:06:16.48,Default,,0,0,0,, The unspoken threat.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.64,0:06:21.28,Default,,0,0,0,, Jhery's didn't need to shout like Riena,\N just snubbing Lord Farman sent a clear
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.28,0:06:23.40,Default,,0,0,0,, message,\N subtle,\N but effective.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.43,0:06:23.87,Default,,0,0,0,, Very.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.48,0:06:25.40,Default,,0,0,0,, And the retreat worked.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.12,0:06:28.48,Default,,0,0,0,, Alessane had a healthy baby boy on Dragonstone.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.48,0:06:33.04,Default,,0,0,0,, Prince Aiman,\N Lilac Eyes,\N white gold hair,\N sounds very Targaryen.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.12,0:06:38.16,Default,,0,0,0,, And Jhery's put a dragon egg in his cradle,\N apparently at Alessane suggestion.
