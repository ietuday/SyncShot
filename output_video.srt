1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
You wake up, you scroll, you see the fires,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,400
the floods, the fighting, the fakeness,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,880
posts about war right next to memes, marketing.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,919
Yeah, that juxtaposition is jarring.

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,759
It really is.

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,039
And somewhere in your gut, you know, deep down you feel it.

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,359
Something's off.

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,080
The world feels chaotic.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,679
To very common feeling right now.

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,879
But here's the big question,

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,000
the one we really want to dig into today.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,240
Is the world actually more chaotic than ever?

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,200
Or are we just, you know, experiencing it differently,

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,920
maybe more intensely because we're so plugged in all the time?

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,840
That's the core of it isn't perception versus reality.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay, so let's unpack this feeling,

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,400
because I think well, so many of us are grappling with it.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,240
Absolutely.

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,800
And what's truly fascinating here,

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
I think is how much our perception does shape that reality,

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
especially when we're just bombarded with information constantly.

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,280
Right, right.

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
So our mission in this deep dive is really to look at the sources,

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
pull out the key insights and help you make sense of this,

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,160
this swirling feeling of global unease,

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,160
without getting totally overwhelmed by it.

27
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,719
Yeah, try to understand the different angles on it.

28
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,400
Exactly, different perspectives.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,079
It's so easy to just get swept up in the feeling,

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,599
the panic almost.

31
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,079
But maybe we need to hit pause on that for a second.

32
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,920
Ground ourselves.

33
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,480
Yeah, ground ourselves and maybe look at some data,

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,359
like what do the numbers actually say about this perceived chaos?

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,200
Okay.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Well, I came across this 2023 article from the BBC.

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
And it said, people today are bombarded by something like

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,159
four to five times more negative news than just a decade ago.

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,120
Four to five times, that's huge.

40
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,719
It's a massive jump, right?

41
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,439
And the point was, it's not necessarily

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,719
because the world has completely imploded in ten years.

43
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,280
Right, it's the delivery mechanism.

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,520
It's how we get the news.

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,159
Our attention is being, well, monetized.

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,439
Often through making things sound as dramatic as possible,

47
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,840
sensationalism.

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,439
Absolutely.

49
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,840
It's a direct consequence.

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,040
And this constant exposure, this barrage,

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,160
it creates what psychologists call mean world syndrome.

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Mean world syndrome.

53
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,560
Yeah, because our brains are constantly fed all this negative stuff.

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,880
We start to believe the world is way more dangerous

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,400
than it's statistically or actually is.

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
It skews our whole perspective.

57
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,319
So your brain literally thinks danger everywhere.

58
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,080
Pretty much.

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,879
And you combine that with modern habits, like, you know,

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,600
doom scrolling, just endlessly scrolling through bad news.

61
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,439
Oh, I know that one.

62
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,200
We all do.

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,360
And then you add the, like, TikTok field crisis updates,

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
these super short, intense bursts,

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
our brains are just getting fried constantly

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,000
in this low level alarm state.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,640
Okay, so our brains are being rewired, basically,

68
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,120
to see more danger.

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
But the feeling, it feels so deep, doesn't it?

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,760
Like more than just perception.

71
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,920
It does feel profound.

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
So are we just perceiving chaos

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
or could there be something else going on?

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,400
Because let's be honest.

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,640
Wars, injustice, climate issues.

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,600
They've always been around.

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,599
True.

78
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,599
History isn't exactly peaceful.

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,599
Right.

80
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,599
So what's really changed?

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
Maybe it's the lens.

82
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,599
The way we see it all.

83
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,599
It's 2E47 now.

84
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,159
It's algorithmically boosted.

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,319
And honestly, it's just exhausting for so many people.

86
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,319
Mm-hmm.

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,359
Understanding that amplification, that constant exposure,

88
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,319
it really helps validate why you might be feeling this way.

89
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,319
Yeah.

90
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,319
It makes sense of the exhaustion.

91
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,319
It does.

92
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,959
And that validation, maybe that lets us go a bit deeper.

93
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:18,959
Yeah.

94
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,359
To ask if this chaos isn't just, you know, external noise,

95
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,359
but something more fundamental.

96
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,920
OK.

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Like what?

98
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,120
Well, think about something like J.

99
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,880
Krishnamurti, the philosopher.

100
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,280
He had this quote that just, it hits hard.

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,160
He said, it is no measure of health to be well adjusted

102
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,040
to a profoundly sick society.

103
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,720
Wow.

104
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
OK.

105
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
Yeah, that lands.

106
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Right.

107
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
He believed that the conflicts, the division,

108
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,160
the violence out there, it all starts inside.

109
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,480
In the confused, fragmented human mind.

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,080
So the external chaos reflects internal chaos.

111
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,760
That's the idea he puts forward.

112
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
What if the mess out there is actually rooted

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,959
in our own inner sort of disquiet?

114
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,959
How does that change how we approach things?

115
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,799
Maybe it's not just about reacting to headlines.

116
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,679
Who is it out there or in here, or both?

117
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,679
It's interesting because, you know, spiritual traditions,

118
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,639
philosophies, they've been wrestling with this for ages

119
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,879
long before Twitter existed.

120
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,000
From millennia, yeah.

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
And what's fascinating is how consistent

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,959
some of the core insights are across really different traditions.

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,560
Like what?

124
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,639
Give me an example.

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,879
OK, take Buddhism.

126
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,159
Talks about Dukha.

127
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,240
Often translated as suffering, or maybe unsatisfactoryness.

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
Unsatisfactoryness, OK.

129
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,200
It's not just about big pain.

130
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,000
It's that fundamental background hum of unease

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
we feel when we cling to things that are always changing.

132
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,440
Yeah.

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
Which is very relevant when you're scrolling

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
through a newsfeed, right?

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,120
Absolutely.

136
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,480
Nothing stays the same for five minutes online.

137
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,360
Exactly.

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,879
So Buddhism suggests a certain level of this disease is just

139
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,960
part of existence.

140
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,160
Then you've got, say, Taoism, which sees chaos in order

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
not as enemies, but as Yin and Yang.

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,400
They're always dancing together in balance.

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
It's like disorder isn't just bad.

144
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,680
It's often needed for new things to emerge.

145
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,439
A necessary part of the cycle.

146
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,560
Kind of, yeah.

147
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,520
And then there's Vedanta from ancient Hindu philosophy.

148
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,200
It talks about the world as Maya.

149
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,800
Maya, illusion, right?

150
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,879
Well, not exactly unreal, like a dream, maybe more like a compelling

151
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,320
appearance that can be deceptive if you take it

152
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
as the only reality.

153
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,760
It suggests that finding inner clarity,

154
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,039
that's your real compass in this big swirling show.

155
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,039
Okay.

156
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
So putting these together, Buddhism, Taoism, Vedanta.

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,240
If you connect the dots, maybe chaos isn't a mistake.

158
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,839
Maybe it's not a bug in the system.

159
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,480
Maybe it is the system or a core part of it anyway.

160
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,800
And if that's true, then our task isn't necessarily

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,719
to fix the whole world before we find some inner peace.

162
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,159
Maybe it's the other way around.

163
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,599
So find the stillness within the chaos.

164
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
That's the question it raises, isn't it?

165
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,560
How do we do that?

166
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,640
How do we find that stillness when everything feels

167
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
like it's constantly shifting and turning?

168
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
It's a huge question.

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
And, you know, trying to get a feel

170
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,920
for how widespread this is right now,

171
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,080
I went online, looked at places like Reddit.

172
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,920
Oh, yeah.

173
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
What did you find?

174
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,840
Well, forms like Ask Asia, various spirituality subs.

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,640
You see loads of threads with titles.

176
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Like, why does everything feel so unstable

177
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,200
or does anyone else feel the energy is just off lately?

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,719
People are definitely feeling something

179
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:18,639
and trying to name it.

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,439
Looking for connection, for validation.

181
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,279
Totally.

182
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,479
They want to know they're not alone in feeling this way.

183
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,240
And what are people actually saying in those threads?

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,159
What's this sort of emotional flavor?

185
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,560
Oh, it's intense.

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
I saw one comment somebody wrote,

187
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,399
it's like the planet has anxiety.

188
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,639
Wow, that captures it.

189
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,480
Doesn't it?

190
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,000
Another one said, we're all grieving something,

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,879
even if we don't know what it is.

192
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,879
Ooh, yeah.

193
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,879
That points to this idea of a kind of global emotional

194
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,439
contagion, stress going viral, burnout,

195
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,639
becoming the baseline state for so many.

196
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,000
Viral stress.

197
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,839
Yeah.

198
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,839
And think about how that leaks out in our daily interactions.

199
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,120
Maybe we're shorter with people, less patient.

200
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,279
It creates friction everywhere.

201
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,240
This isn't just a private feeling inside your head.

202
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,480
It's a shared climate.

203
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
A collective temperature check, for sure.

204
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,600
And it confirms for anyone listening,

205
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,439
it's not just you.

206
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,519
Not just now, it really feels like all of us

207
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,759
are swimming in this chronic uncertainty.

208
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,879
This feeling like we've lost the old rituals,

209
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,519
maybe lost a sense of meaning,

210
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,160
or even just the illusion that we were ever in control.

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,360
That loss of the illusion of control is huge, I think.

212
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Yeah, it validates that shared feeling

213
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,720
that you're definitely not alone

214
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,360
if things feel wobbly.

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,480
And looking beyond our feelings,

216
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,040
our individual, or even collective emotional state,

217
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,600
we also have to look at the bigger picture, right?

218
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,839
The systems themselves.

219
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,800
Right, because our feelings don't just appear out of nowhere,

220
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,640
they're connected to what's happening around us.

221
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,680
Exactly, they exist within a context.

222
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,280
And when you zoom out to that systemic level,

223
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,560
well, the picture doesn't exactly get calmer, does it?

224
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,520
Not really, no.

225
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,440
I mean, we look around, and foundational systems

226
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
seem to be under immense strain.

227
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,800
Political trust seems to be collapsing in many places,

228
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,680
the climate crisis, clearly escalating, AI disruption,

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,200
accelerating like crazy.

230
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
Yeah, the pace of change is relentless.

231
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,599
And our basic structures, education, governance,

232
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,199
healthcare, they all feel like they're,

233
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,079
I don't know, gasping for air sometimes.

234
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,319
It really feels like the bigger systems are either breaking down

235
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,039
or transforming in some really profound,

236
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,599
maybe uncomfortable ways.

237
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,839
There's a futurist, Bruno Marion,

238
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,639
who calls this the chaotic age.

239
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,759
But the chaotic age, okay.

240
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,720
His point is that everything is not just interconnected now,

241
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,799
but it's all moving faster and it's more fragile

242
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,799
than ever before.

243
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
Fragile, yeah, that feels right.

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,879
He uses the analogy, which I think is pretty vivid.

245
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,000
He says, it's like trying to balance a jenga tower

246
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,159
during an earthquake, while writing a unicycle.

247
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay, yeah, that paints a picture.

248
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,840
Jenga, earthquake, unicycle, got it, chaos.

249
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Exactly.

250
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,440
And what's really interesting, and maybe a bit challenging,

251
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,560
is that even how we react to this chaos,

252
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,639
things like the rise of conspiracy theories

253
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,560
or extreme political polarization,

254
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,879
or just pure escapism.

255
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,480
Right, tuning out completely.

256
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,680
Marion might argue, and others too,

257
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,960
that these are actually products of the system

258
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
trying to find some kind of stability,

259
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,159
however dysfunctional.

260
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,360
Think about it.

261
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,920
A conspiracy theory, in a weird way,

262
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,519
offers a simple story, a clear enemy,

263
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,399
a sense of knowing something.

264
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,240
It gives a temporary feeling of control

265
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,639
in a world that feels terrifyingly out of control.

266
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,720
Oh, I never thought of it that way,

267
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,039
as a symptom of the system trying to cope.

268
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,120
But the question is, does it actually help?

269
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,200
Does it address the root causes, the real anxieties,

270
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
or is it just like trying to heal a wound

271
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
by pretending it's not infected?

272
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
It might make you feel better for a minute,

273
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,040
but the infection's still there.

274
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,120
Right, okay, so we've talked about the feeling,

275
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,600
the data, the philosophical angles,

276
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,320
the systemic breakdown.

277
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,160
It can start to feel a bit heavy.

278
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,160
It can, yeah, the doom and gloom factor is real.

279
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,400
So let's shift gears, let's bring it home.

280
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
What can we actually do?

281
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,480
What are the practical strategies here?

282
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,080
Okay, the what now part?

283
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
Exactly.

284
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,480
I saw some advice from therapists at Mass General,

285
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,840
which seemed pretty grounded.

286
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,159
First, basically, turn down the noise.

287
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,840
Do you rate your feed, be intentional?

288
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
The intentional, exactly.

289
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,399
Don't just let the algorithm feed you outrage.

290
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
And second, they literally said touch grass.

291
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,240
Not, yes, get offline, connect with the physical world.

292
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
And it's with the physical world,

293
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,879
simple but probably effective.

294
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,920
They also suggested building micro-rituals into your day.

295
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
Micro-rituals, like what?

296
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,879
Small things, like journaling for a few minutes,

297
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,559
mindfully making a cup of tea,

298
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,639
doing a five-minute meditation,

299
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,039
just creating tiny little pockets of calm

300
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,639
and intention in the middle of the day.

301
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,799
I like that, small, achievable anchors.

302
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,559
Yeah, it's not about suddenly becoming a Zen Master,

303
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,279
just finding small ways to regulate your nervous system.

304
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,320
And maybe moving beyond just coping.

305
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,840
There's this other perspective,

306
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,840
which is about actually embracing the chaos,

307
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,039
finding value in it.

308
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,480
Okay, embracing chaos.

309
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,279
How does that work?

310
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,120
Sounds counterintuitive.

311
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,639
It does, but grateful.org had this list.

312
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,600
12 reasons to embrace chaos.

313
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,560
I won't go through all 12,

314
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,399
but maybe the top three are really powerful.

315
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,320
Okay, give me the top three.

316
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,759
Number one, chaos is a signal.

317
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,519
Something wants to change.

318
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,639
It's like an alarm bell telling you

319
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,960
the old way isn't working.

320
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,039
It's information, not just noise.

321
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,759
Chaos as a signal makes sense.

322
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,639
Number two, it humbles us, it breaks the ego.

323
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,639
When things fall apart, that illusion of control

324
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,399
we talked about, it shatters.

325
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,879
And that can actually open us up,

326
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,039
make us more receptive.

327
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,279
Right, less rigid.

328
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,120
Exactly.

329
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,039
And number three, it births new paradigms.

330
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,720
Think of a forest fire, devastating yes.

331
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,240
But it clears out the old undergrowth

332
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
and makes space for new things to grow.

333
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Chaos can be generative.

334
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,080
Forest fire, clearing space.

335
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,720
Okay, so chaos is signal, chaos is humbling,

336
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,039
chaos is generative.

337
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,639
Yeah, so if you put that together

338
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,799
with the spiritual ideas we touched on,

339
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,720
maybe the goal isn't to escape the chaos

340
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,399
or even just to cope with it.

341
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,440
Maybe it's to become still within it,

342
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,040
to find that quiet center,

343
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
even when the storm is raging all around you.

344
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,000
Finding the eye of the storm inside yourself.

345
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Something like that, yeah.

346
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay, so wrapping this up,

347
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,440
the world might feel like it's completely unraveling right now.

348
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
That's the feeling.

349
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,360
But maybe, just maybe, it's not unraveling,

350
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
maybe it's unfolding.

351
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,440
Unfolding, I like that.

352
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,880
Unfolding us.

353
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,080
Unfolding truths that we're hidden.

354
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,040
Unfolding what just doesn't work anymore, you know?

355
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,960
Making space.

356
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah, an emergence rather than just to collapse.

357
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,400
So the invitation to you listening might be,

358
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,000
don't just numb out, don't log off permanently, maybe.

359
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,400
But breathe, reflect, reach out to people,

360
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,440
get, I don't know, weirdly curious about this feeling

361
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,680
about yourself, but what's happening?

362
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,320
Lean into the uncertainty a little.

363
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,879
Yeah, because maybe clarity doesn't come

364
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,040
when the world magically calms down around us.

365
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
Maybe it comes when you find that calm inside.

366
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,480
That's really where it gets interesting

367
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,840
for you to consider, isn't it?

368
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,440
How do you find that stillness?

369
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,399
And that big respect to Krishna Boardy, doesn't it?

370
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,519
That quote you mentioned earlier,

371
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,560
feels like a good place to land.

372
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,879
To understand the immeasurable,

373
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,960
the mind must be extraordinarily quiet still.

374
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,200
Extraordinarily quiet still.

375
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,240
If we connect that to everything we've discussed,

376
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
the overwhelm, the systemic shifts,

377
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,519
the need for inter grounding,

378
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,759
it really does raise that vital question for all of us.

379
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,240
In this age of noise and chaos,

380
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,519
how do we actively cultivate that quiet stillness?

381
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,960
And maybe more importantly,

382
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,440
what new possibilities, what deep understanding

383
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,519
might emerge for us when we actually do.
