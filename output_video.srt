1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Welcome back to the Deep Dive.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,520
Today we're gonna unpack a really troubling incident

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,359
out of Kolkata, India.

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,160
It's something that's caused quite a shock

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,640
and honestly it touches on much bigger issues.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,480
It really does.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,879
Issues like safety on campus, places we think should be secure.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,559
So our mission today is to give you a clear,

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,879
fact-based look at what allegedly happened

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,560
at South Calcutta Law College.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
We'll look at the response, the implications.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,400
That's right.

13
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,399
While the details are frankly harrowing this kind of case,

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,920
it forces a necessary conversation.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
It makes us ask tough questions about institutional responsibility,

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,679
about safety protocols and schools and colleges.

17
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,200
So for you listening, getting the nuances here is important.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Absolutely.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,599
Okay, so let's dive into the timeline.

20
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:48,439
It starts on June 25th, 2025.

21
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,200
A 24 year old woman, a first year law student,

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,759
she went to South Calcutta Law College.

23
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,920
Just a routine visit, right?

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,759
Exactly.

25
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,159
Just need to disemmit some exam documents.

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,359
But what allegedly happened next

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,559
and where it happened inside the campus guard room

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,559
is just horrifying.

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,759
Guard room, that's yeah.

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,959
Yeah.

31
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,359
The allegation issue was kidnapped, undressed,

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,519
and then gang raped.

33
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,120
And there's this alleged motive mentioned too.

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,519
Reportedly after she rejected American proposal,

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,319
it's profoundly disturbing on multiple levels.

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,719
And the location itself, the guard room,

37
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,400
that's incredibly significant, isn't it?

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,879
I mean, we're talking about a space within the college,

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,879
supposedly under the eye of security.

40
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,719
Right.

41
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,200
Completely upends any idea of campus safety.

42
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,640
It's meant to be a protected zone.

43
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,560
So you have to ask, what went wrong with oversight?

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,840
How does something like this allegedly happen there?

45
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,480
It really speaks to a potential,

46
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,920
well, a catastrophic breakdown of trust.

47
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,439
That betrayal of trust by the very location, it's jarring.

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,759
So let's talk about who was allegedly involved.

49
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,599
Because the roles here, they're distinct

50
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,519
and add to the shock.

51
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,120
They really do.

52
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,519
Okay, so the sources identify the prime accused

53
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,799
as a man named Manojit Mishra.

54
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,759
His background is, well, it's notable.

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,480
He's described as a former student,

56
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,039
apparently a former president of the college's TMC student wing.

57
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,560
TMC, that's the Trinimal Congress.

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,879
Yes, the ruling party in West Bengal.

59
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,400
And maybe most strikingly, he's reportedly

60
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,879
a practicing criminal lawyer now.

61
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,680
Wow, a lawyer.

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,280
Yeah.

63
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,759
So that connection, former student leader,

64
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,039
now a lawyer, definitely raises questions.

65
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,000
Then you have the alleged accomplices.

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,879
Zayab Ahmed, a first year student

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
and Premet Mukherjee, who's in his second year.

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,240
And their alleged role.

69
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,560
According to reports, they stood guard

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,919
while the assault allegedly took place.

71
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,319
And legally, that's critical.

72
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,280
Under Indian Supreme Court president,

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
standing guard during a gang rape

74
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,199
makes you just as liable as the person

75
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,439
committed to the act itself.

76
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,120
So no passive bystanders in the eyes of the law.

77
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,639
Exactly.

78
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,400
It's seen as active facilitation.

79
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,000
And then there's the campus security guard,

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,120
Panaki Banerjee, who's also arrested.

81
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,400
The accusation against him is particularly damning.

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,640
He allegedly ignored the survivor's cries for help.

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,439
Didn't intervene.

84
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,480
Just let it happen.

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,520
That's the allegation.

86
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,319
A complete failure of his duty, essentially

87
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,520
willful negligence if proven true.

88
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,200
You see these different levels.

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,360
A alleged direct perpetrator, alleged facilitators,

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,240
and the alleged failure of the person tasked with protection.

91
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,080
So when you look at that list, a former student leader

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,400
who's now a lawyer, current students, the security guard,

93
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,159
it's not just an outsider attack.

94
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,439
Is it these are people connected to the institution?

95
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,960
What does that suggest?

96
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Well, it's deeply disturbing, isn't it?

97
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,480
It points towards potential systemic issues,

98
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,080
maybe a breakdown within the college's own environment,

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,640
its own checks and balances.

100
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,480
Right.

101
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
It suggests the campus safety isn't just about locking

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
gates or external threats.

103
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,439
It might also be about the culture inside.

104
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,200
Our accountability and respect actually being upheld.

105
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,759
When people within the system are allegedly involved,

106
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,679
it erodes that fundamental trust students need to have.

107
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,359
Yeah, it shifts the focus from just individual actions

108
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,799
to maybe broader institutional responsibility.

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,399
Precisely.

110
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,519
It calls for a hard look at internal safety culture.

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,120
OK, so after the initial shock and these details

112
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,840
about the accused emerged, one thing that happened very quickly

113
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,799
was the medical confirmation.

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,959
That seems crucial here.

115
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:04,840
Absolute vital.

116
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,919
In sexual assault cases, objective evidence like this

117
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,799
is paramount, especially when survivors often face

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,560
displeief.

119
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,039
So what did the medical exam find?

120
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, it was conducted on June 26, the day after the alleged incident.

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
And the findings, according to sources, were stark.

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,560
They detailed forceful penetration, presence of bite marks,

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,360
nail scratches, other signs of assault on her neck and body.

124
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,279
So direct physical evidence?

125
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,879
Yes.

126
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,039
Powerful corroboration of her account.

127
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,920
It provides that objective validation, which

128
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,719
is so important for the investigation and, frankly,

129
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,159
for the survivor.

130
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,480
And there's more.

131
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,319
The police seized mobile phones from all the accused.

132
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,680
The digital angle.

133
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,000
Right.

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,639
They're looking into whether videos might

135
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,360
have been taken.

136
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,519
There's suspicion of potential recording, maybe even a blackmail

137
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,920
angle being explored.

138
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,759
If digital evidence like that exists,

139
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,040
it could be incredibly significant for the case.

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,600
And the speed of the investigation,

141
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,680
the arrests that also stands out, things move fast.

142
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
They really did.

143
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,199
Which usually signals that authorities

144
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,480
are treating it with extreme seriousness.

145
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,360
Mischro was arrested on June 26, right after those medical findings

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,639
came out.

147
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,759
So very next day.

148
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,959
Then, Ahmed and Mukherjee on the 27th and the guard,

149
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,759
Banerjee on the 28th.

150
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,039
So, boom, boom, boom.

151
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,120
Quick succession.

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,279
And importantly, they formed a special investigation team,

153
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,839
an SIT, led by ACP Pradip Kamargosal.

154
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,800
An SIT isn't just regular policing.

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,439
It's a dedicated unit.

156
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,399
Often for complex or sensitive cases like this one,

157
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,920
it shows a commitment to a thorough, hopefully swift

158
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
investigation.

159
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,120
That quick action sends a message, definitely.

160
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,800
Which brings us to the legal side of things.

161
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,759
You mentioned the complicity aspect earlier.

162
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
Let's unpack that a bit more.

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
How does the law view this?

164
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,000
OK, so what's really important here

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is how Indian law, specifically shaped by Supreme Court rulings,

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
looks at gang rate.

167
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,079
The principle is pretty clear.

168
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,280
Everyone involved is considered equally liable, criminally.

169
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,720
Even if they didn't physically commit the assault itself.

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,040
Correct.

171
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,759
Even those who, like the two students, allegedly did,

172
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,480
just stood guard.

173
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,040
The legal thinking is that facilitating the crime,

174
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,200
ensuring it can happen without interruption,

175
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,680
makes you an active participant.

176
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
It's about deterring any kind of assistance.

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
So the charges reflect that.

178
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Yes.

179
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,920
All four, they serious charges, including gang rape

180
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,640
and aiding the crime.

181
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,040
The penalties are severe, rightly so,

182
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,480
reflecting a societal stance against such violence.

183
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
The law basically tries to ensure

184
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
there's no loophole for thinking, oh,

185
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
I wasn't the main one involved.

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,080
That makes sense legally.

187
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,320
Now, given everything we've discussed,

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,439
the brutality, the location, the people involved,

189
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,839
the public reaction must have been intense.

190
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,639
Oh, absolutely.

191
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,120
Wide spread outrage.

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,399
Protests erupted, particularly on campuses across Kolkata.

193
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,680
It really struck a nerve.

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,879
And the sources mentioned this isn't the first time recently.

195
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,360
There were echoes of another case.

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,879
That's right.

197
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,959
The RGCAR medical student rate murder case from 2024.

198
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,480
People drew parallels.

199
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,439
Both involved horrific violence against students

200
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,680
connected to educational institutions.

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,120
It taps into this ongoing fear and frustration

202
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,319
about campus safety.

203
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,879
So it's not just anger about this one event,

204
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,759
but a pattern people are seeing.

205
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,399
Exactly.

206
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,720
It becomes a symbol of perceived failures.

207
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,040
Student groups, women's rights organizations,

208
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,920
they mobilize quickly, demanding justice for the survivor,

209
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,040
but also demanding systemic changes.

210
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,240
And predictably, it got political.

211
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
How so?

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, the ruling party at West Bengal, the TMC,

213
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,480
you had ministers like Shashi Pongja, promising justice,

214
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,399
but also urging people to keep politics out of it,

215
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,599
treated as a crime-needing investigation.

216
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,479
And the opposition?

217
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,239
The BJP, the main opposition, they immediately

218
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,319
framed it as evidence of deteriorating

219
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,279
law and order under the TMC government,

220
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,279
saying student safety is at risk across the state.

221
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,239
So you see how personal tragedy instantly

222
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,399
becomes fodder for political arguments.

223
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,319
Yeah, that interplay is almost inevitable, unfortunately.

224
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,959
So looking ahead, where does the case stand now?

225
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,919
The investigation is ongoing.

226
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,000
Very much so.

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,799
The SIT is working meticulously.

228
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,360
They're collecting physical evidence,

229
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,280
analyzing that digital data from the phones

230
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,160
we mentioned, gathering witness statements,

231
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,400
its painstaking work.

232
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,319
And the phone data could be key.

233
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,639
Potentially, yes.

234
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,240
Especially if it confirms recordings or communication

235
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,759
related to the alleged crime, maybe shedding light

236
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,600
on intent or planning like that possible blackmail angle,

237
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,680
that could be crucial evidence.

238
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
What are the next steps in court?

239
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,240
We'll likely see bail hearing schedule soon for the accused.

240
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,920
After the investigation progresses further,

241
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,840
the prosecution will formally frame the charges against each

242
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,680
of them.

243
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,600
That's a major step towards trial.

244
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,440
The strength of the evidence collected now,

245
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
especially that forensic and potential digital evidence

246
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,399
will be vital.

247
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,160
This whole case is just, it's gut wrenching.

248
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,519
The alleged violence, the breach of trust

249
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,280
in a supposedly safe place, the alleged involvement

250
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,360
of people from within the institution, even security,

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
it's all deeply disturbing.

252
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,960
It truly is.

253
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,960
But maybe the swift medical confirmation, the fast arrests,

254
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
maybe that offers a small measure of hope

255
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,199
that the path to justice will be pursued seriously.

256
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,919
So reflecting on all this, what should you, the listener, take away?

257
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,839
I think this case is a powerful and painful reminder

258
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,319
that we constantly need to demand

259
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,120
that our educational institutions are truly safe,

260
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,079
not just on paper, but in reality.

261
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,120
It forces us to ask hard questions about accountability.

262
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,959
Who is responsible when safety fails so badly?

263
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,000
And it compels us to think about our own role

264
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,639
in demanding that accountability.

265
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,799
It's not just about this one terrible incident.

266
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,559
It's about the systems, the culture

267
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,719
that allowed it to happen.

268
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,759
We need institutions that don't just talk about safety,

269
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,119
but actively ensure it listen to survivors

270
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,279
and act decisively when trust is broken like this.

271
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,679
That promise of a safe campus has to be real.
