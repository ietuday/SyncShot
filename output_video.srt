1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Imagine this, a young king, barely a man, just returned to his capital alone, safe for his dragon.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,000
The realm he's inherited is, well, drowning in debt, fractured by old loyalties,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,679
and about to be rocked by a scandalous, secret marriage. What do you even do in that situation?

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,640
Right. How do you begin to lead a kingdom from the brink?

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,960
Exactly. It's a truly monumental time of testing, as they call it, a real crucible moment.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,880
And today we're taking a deep dive into the extraordinary early reign of King J. Heres or Targaryen,

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
you know, the conciliator of the wise.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
And we'll explore how he navigated precisely that challenge to not just survive,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,079
but fundamentally remake his entire realm.

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,960
That's quite a story.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
Our insights today aren't just from, you know, dry historical texts.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,719
We're drawing from the meticulous records of Grandmaster Benefer, alongside personal observations

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,600
from other contemporary lords and ladies who were closest to the throne.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Which gives us this incredibly unique, almost intimate view of a pivotal moment in history.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
It's like we're right there.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,560
Pretty much. So our mission in this deep dive is to unpack the crucial decisions and strategic moves

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,599
J. Heres made in his first few months on the Iron Throne.

18
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,560
We'll reveal how he masterfully consolidated power, healed deep political rifts,

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,960
transformed the crowns, well, shattered finances, and definitely handled the controversial matter

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
of his marriage, all while laying the groundwork for what would become one of history's longest

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
and most prosperous reigns.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
And as you'll see, it's not just about wielding power, but about something far more subtle

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
and ultimately more effective.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,440
Definitely.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
So picture this scene.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,800
King J. Heres or J. Heres Targaryen finally arrives back in King's Landing.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
He's on the wings of his great bronze dragon, Verma Thor, and he's practically alone.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, his queen, Alessand, remained on Dragonstone, which sort of reflects the deep uncertainty

29
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,799
around their marriage and his fraught relationship with his mother, Queen Alissa.

30
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,239
Grandmeister Benefer describes the day as anything but grand gray skies, a persistent drizzle.

31
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,480
But then the sound of Verma Thor's wings fills the air, his bronze scales glinting as he sweeps over

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
the city.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,039
And despite the gloom, a cheer erupts from the common folk.

34
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,319
It's more than just the landing.

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,520
It's a reintroduction.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,800
He circles the city thrice each time lower, a powerful visual statement before he finally brings

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,760
Verma Thor down.

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
And Benefer notes a profound transformation.

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,240
He says the stripling who had flown to Dragonstone was gone, and in his place was a man grown.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,880
He's taller, broader, not in kingly robes, but salt stained levers.

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,760
And the immediate symbolism is powerful, isn't it?

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
On his sword belt, he carries black fire, his grand sire's sword.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
Benefer actually recalls a shiver of fear when he saw it, admitting he wondered if he was a

44
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,840
fool to return.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
Can you imagine?

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,600
But that fear was instantly dispelled when the young king, as he slid from Verma Thor's back,

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,560
simply smiled.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,440
Lord Tully, a witness, described it as if the sun had broken through the clouds.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
It is very first words to his assembled court.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
By lords, we have work to do.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,840
Talk about a clear, decisive statement of intent, no messing around.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
A king who understands he inherited a mess.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
And one of the very first pieces of work was confronting that strained relationship with his

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
mother, Queen Alyssa.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
Right, she wasn't even there to greet him.

56
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,520
What passed between them when he sought her out is, well, untold,

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,680
but she appeared later with her face red and puffy from weeping.

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,479
Oof.

59
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,719
She attended court functions afterwards, but tellingly, Benefer notes,

60
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,560
there was no joy in her, and she lost her seat at council sessions.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Wow, a swift, if painful assertion of his own authority.

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,639
And it really set the stage for his immediate focus, remaking his council.

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,160
He kept some proven men like Lord Damon Valerian,

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,040
his hand, and Lord Corbray as commander of the city watch.

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
Okay, some stability there.

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,360
But then he started making some truly unconventional appointments,

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
almost signals that things were going to be different.

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,440
Oh, like who?

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,320
Absolutely.

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,080
For Master of Laws, he named Albin Massey, Lord of Stone Dance.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
This is a man who, just three years prior, have been forging a Maester's chain.

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
A Maester, not a typical Lord.

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,480
Exactly.

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,760
Massey, despite a twisted spine that made him limp,

75
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,760
famously declared, I do not limp when I read, nor when I write.

76
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,400
It was all about competence over, you know, physicality, a very pragmatic approach.

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,120
Interesting.

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,520
What else?

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,120
Then, for Lord Admiral, he chose Manfred Redwine.

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,200
And that was a significant move because it was the first time this role went to someone

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,240
not of House Valerian.

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
Breaking tradition, though.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Big time.

84
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,640
But his choice for Master of Coin, replacing Edwell Keldigar,

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
whose taxes were wildly unpopular.

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
That was perhaps his boldest.

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,319
Ah, yes, Keldigar.

88
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,840
I bet people were happy to see him go.

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,640
Oh, everyone in King's Landing rejoiced at his dismissal.

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,760
J. Harry's even praised Celticar's daughters, who remained with Queen Alessand, a nice touch.

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
But this new appointment, it was a real shake-up.

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't keep us in suspense.

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,120
Indeed.

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,520
It was Rigo Draz, a merchant, trader, and money-changer from Pentos, who had risen from nothing.

95
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,439
From Pentos, not even from Westeros.

96
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,680
Nope, not a Lord, not a Knight.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
J. Harry's essentially made him a Lord, which led to the amusing moniker.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
The Lord of Air.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,080
The Lord of Air, right?

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,000
Draz's quip was apparently, if I could tax air, I would be a Lord indeed.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,439
Ha, okay, I like him.

102
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,280
But this wasn't just about merit.

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
It was a profound shift.

104
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
J. Harry's was showing the realm that loyalty and ability,

105
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,759
even from outside the traditional noble circles, would be rewarded.

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,680
This was a King willing to break all norms for the right person.

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
He wasn't afraid to ruffle feathers, clearly.

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,640
Not at all.

109
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,560
And he didn't stop there.

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,439
He also forcefully dismissed Septimathius,

111
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,240
described as a fat and furious prelate,

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
who had loudly railed against incestuous unions.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
A pretty clear jab at the King's own marriage, yeah.

114
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,319
Exactly.

115
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,439
Mathias scoffed that the faith would condemn them.

116
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,120
But J. Harry's calmly replied,

117
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,199
we shall have no lack of septence.

118
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,840
Meaning?

119
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,319
He kept Septin Oswick and Septa Isabel,

120
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
and then almost as an afterthought,

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
mentioned a young man coming from Highgarden to see to our library.

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,399
His name is Barth.

123
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Septin Barth, okay, he becomes important later, right?

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
Usually important.

125
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,080
Yeah.

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,600
Mathias was dismissive of him saying he had no knowledge of this Barth,

127
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
to which J. Harry simply retorted,

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
nor of many other things.

129
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,480
Bouch, burn.

130
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,680
It said that Mathias, too corpulent to write a horse,

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
later passed Septin Barth,

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,680
who was traveling alone on a donkey,

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,920
while Mathias was in a gilded wheelhouse.

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,720
The visual contrast just highlights J. Harry's preference

135
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,920
for quiet wisdom over pompous authority.

136
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,400
And his changes went far beyond the council, you said.

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh, yes.

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,920
He swept through dozens of lesser offices

139
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,720
from the keeper of the keys to the castle rat catchers.

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,360
And crucially, he commanded that the red-keep dungeons

141
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,200
be cleaned and emptied.

142
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,360
Emptying the dungeons after Maygore,

143
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,639
that must have been something.

144
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
Freeing prisoners, some innocent,

145
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
some who had apparently gone quite mad

146
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
from his uncle's grim reign.

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,600
He was truly reshaping the entire administration

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,960
from the top down to the very foundations of the castle itself.

149
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay, so new council and new administration,

150
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,120
what about the powerful lords,

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,320
like Rogar Barathion?

152
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,440
Ah, yes.

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
With his new men in place,

154
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,040
J. Harry's then sent for Lord Rogar.

155
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,280
This was a high-stakes move.

156
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,840
I bet.

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
Rogar was handed before, married the king's mother,

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
lots of power there.

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,680
And Rogar's own brothers offered conflicting advice,

160
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,320
Sir Bore is suggesting he joined the Night's Watch,

161
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
Garen and Ronald urging defiance.

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
But Rogar, confident, maybe overconfident,

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
went alone, believing he could take the black then if I choose.

164
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
So he shows up in King's Landing.

165
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,360
And when he arrived,

166
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
the throne room was deliberately emptied,

167
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
safe for the council and King's Guard,

168
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
a clear message of intimacy,

169
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,199
but also the king's absolute control.

170
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,399
Setting the scene.

171
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,399
It was a humbling entry for Rogar.

172
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,680
He fell to one knee,

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,519
laid his sword before the Iron Throne,

174
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,560
and offered himself.

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
Then J. Harry's, what did he do?

176
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,360
J. Harry's, though,

177
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
showed remarkable wisdom.

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,279
He acknowledged Rogar's past intentions were,

179
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
for the good of the realm as you saw it,

180
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,840
and shrewdly differentiated between

181
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
treasonous actions and foolish words.

182
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,600
That's surprisingly lenient or strategic.

183
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
Both, maybe.

184
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
This wasn't just forgiveness.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
It was a calculated embrace.

186
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,600
He even expressed genuine gratitude.

187
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,280
Gratitude for what?

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
Telling Rogar,

189
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
I would not sit upon this throne,

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
if not for you,

191
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
recalling how Rogar had taken them in

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
when they were seeking refuge.

193
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,480
He explained his need for strong loyal men,

194
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,080
because he knew his reign would face

195
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
impending tests of his resolve.

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
It's almost like he was saying,

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
I understand your past,

198
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,159
but I need you for the future.

199
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,399
Recruiting him in a way.

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,279
Exactly.

201
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,800
And his conditions for pardon

202
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,159
were both stern

203
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,920
and surprisingly conciliatory.

204
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
Rogar would never speak against him

205
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
or Queen Alsanne again,

206
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
and crucially,

207
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
he would become Alsanne's loudest champion.

208
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, fair enough.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
But the truly unexpected part

210
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,879
was that Queen Alissa,

211
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,920
his mother,

212
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,519
was to return to Storm's end

213
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,519
with Rogar as husband and wife,

214
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,159
to be shown only honor and courtesy.

215
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,799
Whoa.

216
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,399
So sending his own mother back

217
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,840
with the guy he just parted in.

218
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,000
A bold move to solidify the peace.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Rogar did inquire about his brothers,

220
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,559
Sir Orin.

221
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,639
Ah, the one who wanted defiance.

222
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,439
Yeah.

223
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,600
Jayri's sentenced him to 10 years of exile

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,039
in the distant free cities,

225
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,039
a more lenient fate than the wall.

226
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,120
The Orin later died in battle anyway.

227
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,079
A small detail.

228
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,279
But the real power play,

229
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,120
the true symbolic act was something else,

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,840
wasn't it?

231
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,039
Oh, absolutely.

232
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,639
It was when Jayhary's took Rogar

233
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,399
to see Verma Thor, his dragon,

234
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,759
feasting on a charred bull.

235
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,399
A subtle.

236
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,159
Jayhary's refused hostages,

237
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,279
telling Rogar,

238
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,319
I have your word,

239
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,679
that is all that I require.

240
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,360
Yet grandmaster benefor's insight here is crucial.

241
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,159
He noted that the King's unspoken message was clear.

242
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,639
Every man and maid and child

243
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,399
in the Stormlands is my hostage,

244
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,679
whilst I write him.

245
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,079
Chilling so mercy-backed

246
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,559
by overwhelming unspoken power.

247
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,719
It was a subtle yet unmistakable display.

248
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
He wasn't just offering peace,

249
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,919
he was demonstrating the very real consequences of breaking it.

250
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,279
This blend of clemency

251
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
and quiet strength forged a deeper loyalty

252
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,439
than simple conquest ever could have.

253
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,240
And it worked.

254
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,039
Seems so.

255
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,279
The reconciliation was sealed that night with a feast.

256
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,519
Rogar sitting beside Queen Alyssa

257
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,360
and publicly toasting love and loyalty

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,319
to Queen Alysanne.

259
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,719
A political threat turned into a powerful ally.

260
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,240
Okay, so that's one major problem, Hamilton.

261
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,679
But you mentioned two others,

262
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,120
the money and the marriage.

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,839
Right.

264
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,919
So with the realm being subtly remade

265
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,799
and Rogar Baratheon brought back into the fold,

266
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,519
J. Heary still had two colossal problems

267
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,719
looming over him,

268
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,120
an empty treasury and mounting debt,

269
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,959
and the jar of wildfire.

270
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,719
That was his secret marriage.

271
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's tackle the money first.

272
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,879
How bad was it?

273
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,279
Dyer.

274
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,639
The immediate gold shortage was skillfully handled

275
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,439
by Rigo Dras, his new master of coin.

276
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,639
Ah, to Lord of Air.

277
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,519
The very same.

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Dras secured three substantial loans

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,879
by playing the powerful Iron Bank of Bravos

280
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,399
against its rivals in Tyrosian Mergenius move, really.

281
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,840
Playing the banks off each other.

282
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,480
Nice.

283
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
This allowed construction on the drag and pit to resume,

284
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,840
which was a visible sign of progress and stability.

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
But both Dras and J. Heary's new,

286
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,519
this was just a stopgap.

287
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,639
Long term, they needed a sustainable source of income

288
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,000
without provoking rebellion.

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right, because rebellions are expensive.

290
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,960
Exactly.

291
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,279
And J. Heary's had a clear philosophy on taxes.

292
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,159
Nothing is so costly as putting down rebellions.

293
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,399
He wasn't going to just demand gold from his lords

294
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,199
like his uncle Mager had, which only fuelled resentment.

295
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,559
So what was his plan?

296
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,799
Instead, he implemented a clever strategy

297
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,679
of taxing fine and costly things from across the sea.

298
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,600
We're talking silk,

299
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
Samite, gemstones, mirage lace,

300
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,439
dornish wines, gilded helms, and especially spices.

301
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,799
Luxury goods basically.

302
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,439
Precisely.

303
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,480
His rationale was brilliant,

304
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,319
truly showing his understanding of human nature.

305
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,639
To avoid them, he reasoned,

306
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,759
a man need only forego his pepper, his silk, his pearls.

307
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,720
The men who want these things desire them desperately.

308
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,799
They may squawk, but they will pay.

309
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,879
Aha, taxing desire.

310
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,600
That's smart.

311
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,879
This wasn't just about revenue.

312
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,559
It was a tax design to be tolerated

313
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,960
because it targeted desires, not necessities.

314
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
He also introduced the ventilation tax,

315
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,279
a levy on building or expanding castles.

316
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,439
Attacks on building castles, why?

317
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,960
This served a dual purpose.

318
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,080
It generated revenue while also subtly discouraging lords

319
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
from building stronger fortifications

320
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,159
that might tempt them to defy the king.

321
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,079
It was a tax that shaped behavior

322
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,759
as much as it raised funds.

323
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,480
Very clever.

324
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,679
Okay, so finance is stabilizing now the marriage,

325
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,159
the elephant or maybe the dragon in the room.

326
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,719
Exactly.

327
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,759
With his finance is beginning to stabilize,

328
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,919
Jerry's then turned to the other massive issue,

329
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,919
legitimizing his marriage.

330
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,000
Queen Alessand returned on silver wing after a half a year apart.

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,439
Must have been quite the reunion.

332
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,759
And the second wedding was a stark contrast

333
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,319
to the first more famous golden wedding.

334
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:48,959
How so?

335
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,200
This one was simpler, less costly,

336
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,000
with perhaps a thousand attendees instead of 40,000.

337
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,720
It was held beneath the iron throne,

338
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
officiated by Septim Barth, the quiet scholar.

339
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
Barth again, he's everywhere.

340
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
Notable guests included Lord Rogar and Queen Alissa,

341
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,160
now returned from Storm's End,

342
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
licking reconciled.

343
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
And perhaps most talked about,

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,080
Queen Rheeda Targaryen arrived on Dreamfire

345
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,800
to see her siblings wed and visit her daughter area.

346
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,720
Reena, Jehari's sister, right.

347
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,400
That adds another layer of complexity.

348
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,199
Definitely.

349
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,799
And Ada Alessand's insistence,

350
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,199
the wedding was followed by a very public betting ceremony.

351
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:23,840
Oh, right.

352
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
To prove, well, you know.

353
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,000
To erase any doubts about the marriage's legitimacy,

354
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Lord Rogar, apparently roaring drunk and ever the showman,

355
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,840
even led the men who disrobed Alessand.

356
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,679
It was a definitive public statement.

357
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,879
No more secrets.

358
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,360
So marriage is public now.

359
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
How did the Faith react?

360
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,000
That was the big worry, wasn't it?

361
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,639
It was the worry.

362
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,679
With the marriage no longer a secret,

363
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,559
the realm waited.

364
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,520
Jehari's believed his marriage would succeed

365
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,680
where his brother Aegon's had failed,

366
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,840
because several crucial conditions had changed.

367
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,720
What had changed?

368
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,520
Well, the current high septin was apparently complacent

369
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,000
and cautious, not looking for a fight.

370
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,640
The Faith militant, the sores and stars

371
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,720
were broken after Megger's wars.

372
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
And crucially,

373
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,200
Jehari's and Alessand would travel with their dragons.

374
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Ah, the dragons.

375
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,320
Always the dragons.

376
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,400
Unlike Aegon and Reena who were vulnerable,

377
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and Jehari's strategy was truly astute.

378
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
He said,

379
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,159
My father and my uncle fought words with steel and flame.

380
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,600
We shall fight words with words

381
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,279
and put out the fires before they start.

382
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
Fight words with words, so propaganda.

383
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,279
Essentially yes, a PR campaign.

384
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,399
He didn't send knights.

385
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,439
He sent preachers.

386
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:31,840
He sent seven speakers across the realm

387
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,639
to promote Queen Alessand's kindness,

388
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
her sweet and gentle nature,

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,759
and her love for all the people.

390
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,439
Selling the queen to the people.

391
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,600
These included powerful voices

392
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,720
like Queen Eleanor,

393
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,759
the Black bride,

394
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,920
who gave eloquent testimony

395
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,840
and septivialante.

396
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,920
A healer said to perform miracles.

397
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,759
And for those who challenged them with scripture.

398
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,720
You had an answer.

399
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,200
They had a powerful theological argument

400
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,960
crafted by Jehari's,

401
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,360
Oswik and especially Septine Barth.

402
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
The doctrine of exceptionalism.

403
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,399
Talked through exceptionalism.

404
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,440
This hints fancy.

405
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,080
It basically affirmed the Faith's general prohibition

406
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
on incest,

407
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
but argued that Targaryens were,

408
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,960
well, different.

409
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
Their Valerian roots,

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,519
unique physical features,

411
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,200
their ability to fly dragons,

412
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
it all set them apart,

413
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,240
marking them as exceptions to the rule.

414
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
So it's wrong for you,

415
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
but okay for us,

416
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
because dragons.

417
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360
Pretty much, yeah.

418
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
Septine Alfen even used a lion

419
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,000
and orox analogy

420
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,840
to explain their unique status.

421
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
And the quickwooded Septine Baldric

422
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,280
had a famous reply to a hedge knight

423
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,400
who apparently asked if you could

424
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
fuck my sister too.

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,240
Oh boy.

426
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,040
What did he say?

427
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
Baldric apparently shot back.

428
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
Go to Dragonstone and claim a dragon.

429
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,879
If you can do that, sir,

430
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,639
I will marry you and your sister myself.

431
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,559
Okay, that probably shot him up.

432
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,360
You think so.

433
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,799
It was a masterful campaign

434
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,919
of public relations

435
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,600
and theological justification.

436
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, it's hard to definitively prove

437
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,679
why a conflict didn't happen,

438
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,360
the high-ceptance silence,

439
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,279
the realm's worryness of war,

440
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,199
and the influence of these seven speakers

441
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,319
and the doctrine

442
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,679
certainly played a massive part

443
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,199
in the realm's acceptance.

444
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,240
An intellectual victory,

445
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
not a military one.

446
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,319
Fascinating.

447
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:04,960
Absolutely.

448
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
But wait, there was still a rhino,

449
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,639
wasn't there?

450
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,759
You said she came to the wedding?

451
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,720
What was her deal?

452
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,519
Yes.

453
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
With the marriage legitimized

454
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,720
and the faith placated,

455
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,159
Jehiri still faced

456
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,519
what Benefer called his

457
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,720
forneous problem yet.

458
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,639
His formidable older sister,

459
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,639
Rhena Targaryen.

460
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,439
The widowed queen,

461
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,720
what was the issue with her?

462
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,559
She had been on a royal progress of her own,

463
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,399
traveling throughout the Westerlands and Riverlands.

464
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,319
But the core problem,

465
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,600
as Rhena herself put it,

466
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
was either I am unwelcome

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,039
or too welcome.

468
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,000
Meaning.

469
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
There were murmurs about the cost

470
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,319
of keeping her court,

471
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:37,120
sure,

472
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,199
but the real issue was the lust for dragons.

473
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,120
Lord saw her,

474
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,399
saw Drainfire,

475
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,559
and wanted that power for themselves.

476
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,679
They saw her as a means

477
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,120
to get their own dragon rider,

478
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,519
maybe marry her off, gain influence.

479
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,439
So she was basically being courted

480
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:52,799
and pressured constantly?

481
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,000
That sounds awful.

482
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,799
Exactly.

483
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:54,960
Yeah.

484
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,120
She desperately needed a secure seat,

485
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,519
a place where she couldn't be leveraged or threatened.

486
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,840
And her bold demand to Jehiri's was clear.

487
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,240
I want my father's seat,

488
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,079
the place where I was born,

489
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,359
I want dragons' stone.

490
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
Dragons' stone.

491
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,079
The ancestral seat.

492
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
She even asserted her better claim.

493
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,440
Wow.

494
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,680
How did Jehiri's and the council take that?

495
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,079
Now, the council was united in their opposition,

496
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,159
seeding dragons' stone.

497
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,759
Unthinkable.

498
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,599
They had no better solution though,

499
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,639
but Jehiri's,

500
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:25,839
ever the conciliator,

501
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,680
came up with one that satisfied everyone.

502
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:29,039
Mostly.

503
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,839
What did he do?

504
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,799
Give it to her.

505
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,559
He granted dragons' own Drainna,

506
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,799
yes, but very clearly as a gift,

507
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,680
not by right.

508
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
He made his authority crystal clear.

509
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,720
He told her,

510
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
you are a queen by courtesy,

511
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,039
but I am king and my writ runs from old town to the wall,

512
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,400
and on dragons' stone as well.

513
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,279
He wouldn't allow his kingdom to be carved in two,

514
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,000
but he recognized her need for status and security.

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,279
So she gets the castle,

516
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,519
but he keeps the ultimate authority.

517
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,080
Smart.

518
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
But then Rhaena made a second crucial demand.

519
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,720
Area.

520
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,120
I want my daughter restored to me.

521
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,680
Area.

522
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
Wasn't she Jehiri's heir at this point?

523
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,240
She was his acknowledge successor, yes.

524
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
Benefer notes Jehiri's agreed,

525
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,319
perhaps too hastily,

526
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,519
but for the moment it's solved a major political and familial headache.

527
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,759
Rhaena gets her daughter back, she gets dragons' stone.

528
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,680
And Rhaena becomes the queen in the east,

529
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,960
a powerful and crucially contented figure in her own domain.

530
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,279
Problem solved for now.

531
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay.

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,319
Jehiri's is really ticking off the problems here.

533
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,319
Council, finances,

534
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,240
marriage, difficult relatives.

535
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,279
He really is.

536
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,240
And as Jehiri's analysis settled into their reign,

537
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
the kingdom found a new stability,

538
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
almost a palpable shift in atmosphere.

539
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,920
Things calming down.

540
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,519
Yeah, and Alessand proving herself far more than just a queen consort

541
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,680
began attending small council meetings.

542
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,599
She turned out to be wise,

543
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,120
well-read, and clever.

544
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,279
A truly welcome voice in the discussions.

545
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,640
A partner, not just a white.

546
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,519
Exactly.

547
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,920
She also made it her mission to remake the court's culture.

548
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,279
Megger's reign had been grim overshadowed by fear,

549
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,599
but Alessand wanted to bring back the joy and splendor

550
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,759
of her father Aene's vibrant court.

551
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,680
More music, less gloom.

552
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,160
Definitely.

553
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,480
She found Tom the strumber,

554
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
making him the new court singer,

555
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,840
and brought in harpists,

556
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,720
mums,

557
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
lysine dancers,

558
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,360
and even the red keeps,

559
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,279
first fool, the good wife,

560
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,279
with his famously rib-old puppets.

561
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,560
A fool named good wife.

562
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,240
Okay.

563
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,720
Sounds like the court was becoming a much livelier place.

564
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,160
It must have been a breath of fresh air

565
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,680
after years of darkness.

566
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,960
All of this pleased the king,

567
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,120
bringing back life and laughter to the red keep.

568
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
But nothing pleased him half so much

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
as the ultimate gift that Queen Alessand gave him

570
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,240
several moons later.

571
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,799
Let me guess.

572
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,160
An heir.

573
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,759
The announcement that she was with child.

574
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,640
A truly happy ending to this initial

575
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,039
challenging period of testing and consolidation.

576
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,080
It promised the future,

577
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,840
not just for the Targaryen dynasty,

578
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
but for a new, revitalized realm.

579
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,559
Wow.

580
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,920
What an incredible deep dive.

581
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,440
We've seen how King Jay Harry's

582
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
from that dramatic,

583
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
almost solitary return,

584
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
just swishly and strategically addressed

585
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
pretty much every major challenge facing his reign.

586
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,640
A divided council,

587
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
a potentially rebellious lord,

588
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,599
an empty treasury,

589
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,360
a super controversial marriage.

590
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,319
He tackled them all.

591
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,519
What's truly fascinating here,

592
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,599
if we connect this to the bigger picture,

593
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,440
is how much of Jay Harry's success

594
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,240
wasn't just about raw power, right?

595
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
It was shrewd diplomacy,

596
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,400
innovative economic policy,

597
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,440
and just a masterful understanding of public perception.

598
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,319
Totally.

599
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,360
He wasn't afraid to make unconventional choices,

600
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,440
like appointing a Pintoshi merchant

601
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
as master of coin,

602
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
or to fight words with words

603
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,040
when steel seemed like the obvious,

604
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,640
maybe leasier answer.

605
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,320
He understood that true authority

606
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,680
often comes from consent

607
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,800
and clever maneuvering,

608
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
not just, you know,

609
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
overwhelming force with dragons,

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
although he had that too.

611
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
He definitely had that in his back pocket,

612
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,680
but he used it sparingly, subtly.

613
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,640
So, what does this all mean for us listening to this?

614
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,280
This deep dive into Jay Harry's early reign

615
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
really makes you wonder, doesn't it?

616
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
When faced with overwhelming challenges,

617
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,680
is it more effective

618
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,280
to wield absolute authority,

619
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
just lay down the law?

620
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
Or is it better to seek consensus,

621
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,120
understanding, and even redefine traditional norms,

622
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
like Jay Harry's in with his taxes,

623
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
or the whole doctrine of exceptionalism?

624
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
It's a tough question.

625
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,880
What stands out to you about his approach as a leader?

626
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,080
Something to think about.
