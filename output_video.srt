1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Welcome curious minds to another deep dive.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,399
Great to be here.

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,879
Today we're soaring high right into one of the most

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,080
talked about films of the summer.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,720
James Gunn's Superman, the 2025 one obviously.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah, a lot of anticipation for this one.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,280
Definitely.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,080
You've asked us to unpack the key insights

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,240
from everything you shared.

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,519
So our mission today is basically

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,199
to distill what makes this movie tick.

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,719
What it means for Superman as a character.

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,679
And yeah, the huge implications

14
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,760
for the whole DC cinematic universe going forward.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,359
Which let's face it needed some implications.

16
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,079
Good ones, hopefully.

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,920
Right.

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,600
I mean, the DC universe has felt kind of stuck, hasn't it?

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,719
Like a perpetual reboot cycle.

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,439
Yeah, less a cohesive world.

21
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,280
More a multi-versing crisis maybe.

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,120
Exactly.

23
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,079
From Justice League, then the Snyder cut.

24
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:47,920
Black Adam.

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Oh, don't forget the flash.

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,840
That was certainly a ride.

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,880
The bewildering ride is one way to put it.

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,040
Just a lot of tonal whiplash.

29
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,799
For sure.

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,120
But now, okay, new blood.

31
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,200
We've got David Cornsweat and the Red Boots.

32
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,679
It's Clark Kent.

33
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,359
Rachel Brosnanhan is lowest lane.

34
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,640
That's exciting casting.

35
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
Very.

36
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,159
She's got that sharp energy you want for lowest.

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:06,760
Totally.

38
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,640
And James Gunn, the Guardians of the Galaxy Gay,

39
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,400
he's taking the reins.

40
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,159
So there's a real buzz.

41
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,439
A different kind of buzz than maybe we're used to for DC.

42
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,079
Right.

43
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,840
So the big question we're digging into is,

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,600
did James Gunn actually save the DC universe with this?

45
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Or is it just another fresh coat of paint

46
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,079
on maybe a shaky foundation?

47
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,079
That's the core of it.

48
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,920
Yeah.

49
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,319
Okay, let's jump into the story itself.

50
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,200
No spoilers.

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
We promise.

52
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,319
Like, keep it spoiler free.

53
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,359
It kicks off in smallville.

54
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,159
We get a younger Superman still kind of figuring things out.

55
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,560
Grappling with his identity, his place.

56
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Yeah, and morality too.

57
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
Yeah.

58
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,480
In this world that feels, well, pretty cynical.

59
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,319
I'm very online.

60
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,480
I think mine aspect is an interesting modern touch.

61
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,319
It is.

62
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,159
And Lex Luthor, he's there sort of simmering in the background.

63
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,480
You feel his presence.

64
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,719
He's always lurking the essential counterpoint.

65
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,920
Definitely, but what's kind of remarkable,

66
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,120
even with global stakes involved.

67
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,719
Would you expect with Superman?

68
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,719
Right.

69
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,560
You do.

70
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah.

71
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,800
But the film's soul feels smaller, more intimate.

72
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Focused.

73
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Focused.

74
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Yeah.

75
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
It's really about the man behind the myth,

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
the hope behind the heat vision, you could say.

77
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I like that.

78
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,319
Getting back to the core of Clark Kent.

79
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,319
Exactly.

80
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,319
And the tone.

81
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,319
This is where it gets really interesting, I think.

82
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,040
How does it feel compared to, say, recent entries?

83
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,120
Well, it's definitely brighter than Snyder's vision.

84
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
No question there.

85
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,919
OK.

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,599
That's a shift.

87
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,400
A big one.

88
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,120
And arguably smarter than Man of Steel in some ways.

89
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Interesting.

90
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,639
How so?

91
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,599
Just in the character work, maybe.

92
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,879
And surprisingly, more grounded than you might expect

93
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,879
from James Gunn.

94
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,239
Right.

95
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,519
Given his track record with Guardians or the Suicide Squad,

96
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,359
Lesany.

97
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,840
Lesany, more earnest.

98
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,359
Yeah.

99
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,239
So what do you think this whole tonal shift really

100
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
means for how we see Superman now?

101
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,320
And maybe even for the whole superhero genre?

102
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,280
Well, it feels like a very deliberate recalibration

103
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,240
for Superman himself, bringing back

104
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,320
that inherent hopefulness, that sincerity.

105
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah.

106
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,120
It's a clear pivot from the darker, more angsty versions

107
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,080
we've had for a while.

108
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,800
It really is.

109
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,719
It feels like DC saying, OK, this is the kind of hero

110
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,320
we want at the center, you know?

111
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,520
Right.

112
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,719
Setting a new baseline.

113
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,680
Exactly.

114
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,319
And in a movie world where, let's be honest,

115
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,040
cynicism and deconstruction are almost the default.

116
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,159
And earnestly hopeful, Superman feels, well, almost radical.

117
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,840
It's refreshing.

118
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
Yeah, it does feel different right now.

119
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,600
It reminds you of that aspirational core,

120
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,439
why these characters clicked in the first place.

121
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,840
And that's a pretty powerful foundation

122
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,520
if you're trying to rebuild something.

123
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,280
And that foundation really extends to the casting, doesn't it?

124
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,840
David Carrantwett as Superman.

125
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Wow, he certainly looks the part.

126
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
The resemblance is uncanny.

127
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,360
It really is.

128
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,080
He walks like Superman, talks like him.

129
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,599
Yeah.

130
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,080
He can even do that little thoughtful brood,

131
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
like a nod to Reeve.

132
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,719
A touch of the classic.

133
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,719
But the key thing, I think, the really significant shift

134
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,439
is that he smiles genuinely.

135
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,159
The warmth.

136
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,480
That boy's got warmth is back.

137
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,000
It makes him feel less like this distant alien god.

138
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,720
And more like just a good guy trying his best

139
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,240
in a really complicated world.

140
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,639
Relatable, even with the cape.

141
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,680
Exactly.

142
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,439
And Rachel Brosnahan is Lois.

143
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,560
What's the take on her?

144
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
Oh, she apparently owns it.

145
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,680
Yeah.

146
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,519
Just sharp, snappy.

147
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,360
Good.

148
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,560
Lois needs that edge.

149
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Totally.

150
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
And crucially, not just a damsel, you know,

151
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,360
or an exposition bot.

152
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,199
Thank goodness.

153
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,040
Right.

154
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,360
And the dynamic between corn, sweat and Brosnahan,

155
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,400
their chemistry, it apparently evolves really nicely.

156
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,240
Right.

157
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,759
From that kind of classic fun newsroom flirtation

158
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,959
to moments that really pack an emotional punch later on.

159
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,800
That's key.

160
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,959
You need that heart.

161
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,759
You really do.

162
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,599
Yeah.

163
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:57,199
Huh.

164
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,680
And we have to mention crypto.

165
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Ah, yes.

166
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,959
The super dog.

167
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,879
Devices, I hear.

168
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,639
Very divisive.

169
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,240
Some fans absolutely loved him.

170
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Thought it was brilliant.

171
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,319
Others, well.

172
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,920
Wanted a laser-eyed out of existence.

173
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,599
Pretty much, yeah.

174
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,159
Personally, I found the idea charming,

175
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,319
but it definitely split opinions.

176
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,480
Always does, adding the animal sidekick.

177
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,879
So thinking about this cast, these iconic roles,

178
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,800
what really stands out to you about them and their chemistry?

179
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,319
Well, it really seems like the casting is perfectly

180
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,959
in service of that tonal shift we were talking about.

181
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,079
Corn, sweat, bringing that genuine warmth back.

182
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,279
That's absolutely crucial.

183
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,279
It lets the audience connect with Superman

184
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,639
on a more human level.

185
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,680
Yeah, it grounds him.

186
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,279
Right.

187
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,480
Which you need for a character that powerful.

188
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,079
And Brosnahan's lowest, it's not just being smart or snappy.

189
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,040
It's about making her an equal.

190
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
A force in her own right.

191
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Exactly.

192
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,399
Which elevates their whole relationship,

193
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,280
that chemistry, that evolution you mentioned

194
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,720
from flutation to something deeper.

195
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,440
That's the emotional core.

196
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
Right, if you don't care about them.

197
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,120
Then the world-saving stuff just doesn't land

198
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,160
with the same impact.

199
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,120
Their dynamic is the anchor.

200
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,400
It really feels like a masterclass in how casting

201
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,640
can shape the whole essence of a character

202
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
for a new generation.

203
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,600
A masterclass, yeah.

204
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,840
And guiding this fresh take, that brings us

205
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,160
squarely to James Gunn's direction.

206
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Because you hear James Gunn, you might think.

207
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,960
He's a peacemaker, the suicide squad.

208
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,240
That kind of wonderfully weird, maybe r-rated energy.

209
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
Exactly, eccentric, sometimes raunchy.

210
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
But here, apparently, he really reigns it in.

211
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
Shows remarkable restraint.

212
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
So less of that.

213
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,440
Way less, no gratuitous raunch, no deep nihilism.

214
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
Instead, the film's described as earnest.

215
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,920
Since here.

216
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,840
Hopeful, even.

217
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,680
Yeah, infused with this palpable sense of hope,

218
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
it's quite a departure for him in a way.

219
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
Interesting.

220
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,159
Where does he find his signature then?

221
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, you can definitely feel the echoes of Richard Donner's

222
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
original Superman.

223
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,719
Ah, the 78 movie, The Touchstone.

224
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:52,399
Absolutely.

225
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,079
Those big, sweeping, wide shots, subtle music cues,

226
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,639
apparently even some riffs nodding to John Williams' score.

227
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,919
Wow, OK.

228
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,799
So leaning into the legacy.

229
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,560
Definitely.

230
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,439
Even the title card is apparently a direct nod to the 78 classic.

231
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,199
But it's not just a retro throwback.

232
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,719
He's walking this tightrope between that

233
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
reverence for the classic stuff.

234
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Retro reverence.

235
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,760
And making sure it actually resonates today with a modern audience.

236
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,880
That's the trick, isn't it?

237
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,320
Balancing nostalgia with a fresh perspective.

238
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,960
Totally.

239
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,320
And from what we're hearing, he mostly

240
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,880
sticks the landing, which is huge for a character

241
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,000
that's beloved this old.

242
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,080
Yeah, that balancing act is just, it's

243
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,920
so critical for a franchise trying to hit reset.

244
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,880
The fact that gun could weave in that Donner DNA, as you said,

245
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,640
without making it feel like a museum piece,

246
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,919
that's a lot about his understanding of Superman's appeal.

247
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,399
Yeah, it shows he gets it.

248
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,519
He's honoring the legacy for the long-time fans,

249
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,599
the ones who remember that classic hero.

250
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,919
With the Christopher Reeve feeling.

251
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:53,759
Exactly.

252
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,240
But he's also making him accessible, relevant

253
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,800
for a new generation who maybe doesn't have that same connection.

254
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,319
It's smart.

255
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,360
It's a calculated risk, really.

256
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,759
Leaning into nostalgia while trying to forge something new,

257
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,120
the fact that it seems to have worked

258
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,439
suggests a pretty clear strategic vision.

259
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,240
Yeah, like they actually have a plan this time.

260
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,439
It means maybe the DCU can finally learn from its past wins

261
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,439
without being totally shackled by them.

262
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,519
Let's hope so.

263
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,839
OK, beyond the creative choices, the numbers always

264
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,000
tell the story, right?

265
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
The box office.

266
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
Always the bottom line, isn't it?

267
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,879
How did it do?

268
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,399
Pretty well.

269
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,120
Pulled in a global opening weekend of $217 million.

270
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Solid start.

271
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,919
Yeah, $122 million, that was domestic, North America.

272
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,200
$95 million, international.

273
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,960
And in the US, it really took off

274
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,400
biggest solo superman debut ever.

275
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,920
Wow.

276
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,120
OK, bigger than Man of Steel's opening.

277
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,520
Yep, domestically at least, now internationally.

278
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,120
The picture's a bit more nuanced.

279
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
Oh, how so?

280
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,600
Well, like in India, it did well-raked in about 25.5 crore,

281
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,680
which is strong, but it got out muscled by a drastic world.

282
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,759
Rebirth, apparently.

283
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,000
Huh, dinosaurs still rule the earth, it seems.

284
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,520
Seems like it in some places.

285
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,040
It suggests maybe some countries

286
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,360
didn't connect quite as strongly.

287
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,319
Any theories why?

288
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:14,839
The thinking is, maybe the film's inherent Americana.

289
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,759
Smallville, Clark's journey in that very US context.

290
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,639
Maybe it doesn't travel quite as universally.

291
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,639
That's possible.

292
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,319
Superman's roots are very tied to that specific American ideal

293
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,120
historically.

294
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,599
Right.

295
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,799
But even with those regional differences,

296
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,639
the overall vibe, reception-wise, seems largely positive.

297
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,240
What are the scores looking like?

298
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,159
Rotten Tomatoes landed at a solid 82%.

299
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,600
Cinema score gave it an A-.

300
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,439
May minus is good.

301
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:41,079
Means audiences walking out were happy.

302
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:41,839
Yeah, definitely.

303
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,439
And online buzz, like on Reddit, mostly love.

304
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:47,079
You still get a few, why did they nerflex debates, of course.

305
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:47,879
Always something.

306
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,959
Always something.

307
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,639
But generally positive.

308
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,240
Critics, like real views, call it a popcorn film with heart.

309
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,000
Nice, hits that sweet spot.

310
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
And yes, some critics felt it leaned maybe a bit too much

311
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,159
into nostalgia or too much setup for the future.

312
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,600
Which is fair, maybe.

313
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,279
It's a fair point, but you kind of expect that, right?

314
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,840
For a franchise rebirth, you have to plan some seeds.

315
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,879
Absolutely, you've got to lay that groundwork.

316
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,159
Can't just be a standalone.

317
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,680
Exactly, you have to set the stage.

318
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,159
And visually, speaking of setting the stage,

319
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,720
this film is apparently just gorgeous.

320
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
Oh yeah, what's the look?

321
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
Kansas has apparently never looked so cinematic.

322
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,240
Just beautiful, sprawling.

323
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,200
And Metropolis glows with this kind of early 2000s

324
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
meets modernist vibe.

325
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,000
Hmm, interesting blend.

326
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
Yeah, and the score hurt it absolutely slaps.

327
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,639
Okay, good music is key.

328
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,159
You'll be humming the theme for days, trust me.

329
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,000
Or so they say.

330
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Nice.

331
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,720
And for the die-hard DC fans, the Easter eggs

332
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,799
are apparently everywhere.

333
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,240
Oh, give us some examples.

334
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,519
Okay, subtle Star Labs nods.

335
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,840
A mention of Karazor L.

336
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,879
Super girl T's.

337
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,240
Exactly, and apparently there's a fortress upgrade,

338
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,000
blueprint that's just chef's kiss.

339
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,879
Nice little details for the fans.

340
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,320
Loads of them.

341
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
So, okay, pulling back to the bigger picture.

342
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Where does all this leave the wider DCU?

343
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,799
The billion dollar question.

344
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,639
Right.

345
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,279
This Superman is really being described

346
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,080
as laying the first, like, true foundational brick

347
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,600
in this new, hopefully coherent DC cinematic universe.

348
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
The first step on a long road.

349
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,240
A very long road.

350
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,039
We know Supergirl, woman of tomorrow is next up.

351
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,879
Yeah.

352
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,799
And a fresh Batman is definitely coming down the line.

353
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,680
Building out the world.

354
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,519
Yeah.

355
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,080
And the real significance here isn't just about one successful movie.

356
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
It's about establishing a clear plan, a unified plan.

357
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
Moving away from the disconnected chaos,

358
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
the tonal whiplash we talked about.

359
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,520
Right, which plagued them for so long.

360
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,600
It really did.

361
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,400
This suggests that maybe DC is finally getting its act together.

362
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,080
And that's probably the most critical takeaway here, isn't it?

363
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
I think so.

364
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,080
Because, look, one film can absolutely set a tone,

365
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
get people excited again.

366
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
Superman seems to have done that.

367
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,200
Yeah, seems like it.

368
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
But the real test, the true test of this new dawn

369
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,679
for the DCU, it's going to be consistency.

370
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,840
Can they keep it up?

371
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,440
Exactly.

372
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,799
Can they maintain this quality, this narrative coherence,

373
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,879
this tonal balance across multiple films, multiple series?

374
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,799
It's a huge challenge.

375
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,600
It's an immense undertaking.

376
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Especially when you look at how other big cinematic universes

377
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
have stumbled, you know?

378
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,080
Superman has given them a strong blueprint, it seems.

379
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,519
But the real question is execution.

380
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,399
Can they build on this reliably over the next, what, five, 10

381
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,399
years?

382
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,399
Just the long game.

383
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,399
That's the long game.

384
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,000
Building something that feels genuinely interconnected

385
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,319
and stays compelling, that will be the ultimate decider on whether

386
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:42,959
this was just a hopeful first step or a real lasting reset.

387
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,959
Well said.

388
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:48,279
So, after diving deep into all of this, is Superman 2025

389
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,159
the definitive, like, ultimate Superman movie?

390
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,159
Probably not ultimate.

391
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,159
That's a high bar.

392
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,159
It is a high bar.

393
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,159
Maybe not the ultimate one.

394
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,159
No.

395
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,720
But is it the Superman we kind of desperately needed right now?

396
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,919
Based on everything we've discussed.

397
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,360
Paul signs point to yes, I think, a resounding yes.

398
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
It feels like it.

399
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,320
It's a film that brings back the heart, the humor, that pure sense

400
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,840
of heroism that maybe felt a bit lost for a while.

401
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Recapturing the essence.

402
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Yeah.

403
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,240
It doesn't, like, totally reinvent the wheel.

404
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
No.

405
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Sounds more like course correction.

406
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Exactly.

407
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,760
It realigns the compass.

408
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,800
And maybe for the whole DC universe.

409
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,520
A much needed realignment.

410
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
For sure.

411
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,680
So, that's our take, pulling together all the insights you shared

412
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
with us.

413
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
But what about you listening in?

414
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Yeah.

415
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
What's your verdict?

416
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,120
Was this Superman everything you hoped for?

417
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,440
Or maybe did it feel a bit too safe, too nostalgic maybe?

418
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,680
Not bold enough for today's superhero landscape.

419
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
It's a fair question.

420
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,520
It's definitely a fascinating moment for DC.

421
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,400
We really invite you to mull over what this new era might truly mean for the future of

422
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
capes and crusaders.

423
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Lots to think about.

424
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Definitely.

425
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,520
Until next time, stay super.
