00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Welcome to The Deep Dive.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,960
Today, we're taking a closer look at the current movie scene,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,199
everything from the big blockbusters to streaming stuff.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,560
And yeah, maybe a few you're wondering about.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,720
Our mission really is to cut through all that chatter

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,320
and pull out the key bits from recent reviews

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,000
and box office numbers.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,440
We've been digging into this source called Real rundown.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,679
This week's Cinema Hits and Misses.

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,960
And this source, it's pretty good at showing you what's

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,600
thought, what's not, and maybe what might make your popcorn

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,960
regret being poked.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
So yeah, we're set for a pretty engaging look

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,039
at what makes a film land or bomb

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,719
or become something else entirely.

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,399
Exactly.

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,439
And I think the real value here is how looking at both

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,760
the critical takes and the audience reactions

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,159
gives you a shortcut.

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,960
You get a real feel for the trends, you know?

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,400
What actually connects with people beyond just the hype?

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,520
Okay, so let's kick things off of the big screen buzz,

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
the theatrical hits.

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,159
First up, Cetara's a mean par.

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm here cons back, and wow, he's still got it.

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,360
Pulling in what, 120 crore in just 10 days?

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
That's impressive.

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Huge number.

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
Definitely.

30
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,520
Now, Real rundown mentions critics calling it important,

31
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,200
but there's also this other view,

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,080
like it's maybe Tari is a mean par 2.0 with Jersey's on.

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,480
So big success, but maybe a question mark on originality.

34
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,800
Yeah, that 2.0 comment is fascinating, isn't it?

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,480
It shows the power of star like I'm here con still has.

36
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,000
He can pull in huge crowds, even if critics aren't totally sold

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,239
on the freshness.

38
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,719
It kind of makes you ask what audiences really want

39
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,319
from actors they love or themes they know.

40
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,280
Is it always about something brand new?

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,719
Or is it comfort, familiarity, especially now?

42
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,200
Right, maybe that feeling of a guaranteed emotional connection

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,599
outweighs the need for pure originality sometimes.

44
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,079
It certainly challenges the idea

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,039
that reviews alone drive success.

46
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,879
That's a really good point.

47
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,039
It's being a big draw.

48
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,039
Let's talk spectacle.

49
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,280
Canapa, Real rundown calls it mythological madness,

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
the movie, which sounds about right.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
It's like a pan-Indian Avengers basically.

52
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,200
You've got fish numenchu, propas, Akshay Kumar,

53
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,120
and Mohanlal, all in one film.

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
Quite the lineup.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,599
Yeah.

56
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,879
The feedback mentioned in the sources specific, though,

57
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,120
has the first half kind of drags, but the climax,

58
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,719
just is fire emoji so.

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,000
Absolute fire, love it.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,960
And that connects to this whole pan-Indian cinema trend,

61
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
doesn't it?

62
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,159
Strategically pulling huge stars from different industries

63
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,639
and makes you think, how much does sheer spectacle

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,159
and star power compensate for maybe slower pacing,

65
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,719
especially in these big mythological epics?

66
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,319
It's a question.

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,079
Yeah, maybe for these massive productions,

68
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,919
the scale, the cast, that is the main event.

69
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,919
A slow start might not matter as much

70
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,599
if the ending delivers that epic payoff people came for.

71
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,919
Right, you forgive the journey of the destination's amazing.

72
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,319
OK, let's switch over to the streaming side of things,

73
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,439
because things are definitely heating up on OTT platforms.

74
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,000
You've got Kajol and Ma, a horror thriller.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,159
The description sounds great.

76
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,879
Creepy temples, shadowy myths, sounds atmospheric.

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,879
Promising setup.

78
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,280
But the source says it ends up with predictable scares.

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,879
Like it's into ordering Biriyani and getting pula.

80
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,639
Ouch.

81
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,840
You know that feeling, right?

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,319
Yes, disappointing.

83
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,800
It points to a real challenge for horror on streaming,

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,639
I think.

85
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,560
You need atmosphere, sharp, but you also need originality.

86
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,639
Predictability just kills the tension,

87
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,000
even if it looks good or has a big star.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
It kind of proves that a familiar story,

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,159
even while made, struggles in a genre built on surprise.

90
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,080
True.

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
But then on the other hand, streaming also gives us F1,

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,520
the movie with Brad Pitt.

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,640
And critics are apparently raving about this one.

94
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Real rundown quotes them calling it

95
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,480
the most enjoyable flick of the year.

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,640
High praise.

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,080
Yeah, he highlights the fast cars, slow-mo close-ups,

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,879
and apparently Brad Pitt looks like a human version

99
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,360
of nitrous oxide, which I guess means super charismatic

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,199
and powerful.

101
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,759
I like that description.

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,000
But what's interesting there is how a film can get such wide

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,879
praise just by nailing its genre basics, adrenaline charm.

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,719
The review doesn't seem to mention any real downsides.

105
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,399
It just delivers pure entertainment really, really well.

106
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,679
Simple, but effective.

107
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,280
Exactly.

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
It suggests maybe there's a real hunger for films

109
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,759
that just focus on doing one thing exceptionally well,

110
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,639
giving you that escapism without trying

111
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,359
to be too complex, just pure, well-executed fun.

112
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,120
OK, so that brings us to the verdict section.

113
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,879
Time for some brutal honesty based on real rundown,

114
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,280
what's worth your time.

115
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,680
First, House full five.

116
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,360
Apparently, it's still trying to be funny

117
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,399
with the same jokes from 2011.

118
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,240
Calls it a cringe fest, though, mentions a decent twist.

119
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,720
Ooh, same jokes.

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,879
Seems like it.

121
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,120
The advice, skip it unless you're drunk or nostalgic.

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,600
Harsh.

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,959
Yeah, fair enough.

124
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,560
What else?

125
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,800
Then there's Pixar's Iliot, described

126
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,639
as a cute space boy adventure.

127
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,879
Sounds nice, but the note is it's sweet,

128
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,079
but it doesn't hit those Pixar-level emotional gut

129
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,879
punches.

130
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,719
The picks are standard, high-barned, clear.

131
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:51,399
Definitely.

132
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,079
For horror fans, 28 years later is back.

133
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,319
The original Fast Zombies, described

134
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,120
as Fast, Furious, and Feral, sounds intense.

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,519
The source says it's a must if you're a fan of the original.

136
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,159
Good to know for genre fans.

137
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,639
And finally, a really intriguing one.

138
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,680
Vyasana Samatham, Ben Tumif, Therathigal.

139
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,399
It's a maleil in film, a dark comedy,

140
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,680
described as having surprising depth.

141
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,639
Specifically, it's a satire about funerals.

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,079
And the note is just, it works.

143
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,319
A satire about funerals, okay, that sounds unique.

144
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,600
And it works.

145
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,439
Interesting.

146
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,720
You know, looking at all these together,

147
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,840
it really shows the sheer range, doesn't it?

148
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,040
From like tired franchises to these really specific niche films

149
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
and sequels that actually land,

150
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
what's fascinating is just how much variety there is.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,439
And how much your own tastes like,

152
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,720
are you feeling nostalgic?

153
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,240
Do you love a certain genre?

154
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,319
Are you open to something weird?

155
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,360
Really decides if it's a watch or skip for you?

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,959
There's no single answer anymore.

157
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,040
Totally.

158
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,199
So let's try and summarize with a quick cheat sheet

159
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,599
pulled from the source.

160
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,920
Sitire, zamine par.

161
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,159
Watch for the emotion, the amir factor.

162
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,000
Maybe skip if you want something totally new.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,839
Got it.

164
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,800
Canapa, watch for that huge climax in the star power.

165
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,719
Skip if you can't handle a slow start.

166
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,560
Makes sense.

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Not, watch for the creepy visuals, the horror mood.

168
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,920
Skip if predictable plots annoy you.

169
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
F1, the movie.

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Watch for pure adrenaline and charm.

171
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,640
Seems like a safe bet, no reason given to skip.

172
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
Sounds like a crowd pleaser.

173
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,560
House full five.

174
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,320
Watch if you still find oxhave funny.

175
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,480
Otherwise, maybe skip.

176
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Right.

177
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,160
And if you're not supposed to make them

178
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
bend them with radical,

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,280
watch if you like dark horse gems, something different.

180
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,600
Skip if niche isn't your thing right now.

181
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,879
That's a good rundown.

182
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,720
And it leaves you with a thought, doesn't it?

183
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,600
How we even define worth watching seems to be shifting

184
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,439
all the time.

185
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,680
The big star is at the rave reviews.

186
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,959
Or is it just a really unique idea that crabs you think about it?

187
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,800
How much does your own situation like,

188
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,199
are you looking for pure escape

189
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,480
or something to really chew on

190
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,399
or maybe do something everyone's talking about

191
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,800
shape what you actually decide to watch next.

192
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
What will you deep dive into?
